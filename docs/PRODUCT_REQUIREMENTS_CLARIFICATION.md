# üìã Product Requirements Clarification

## Current Understanding vs. Questions Needed

Based on the consolidation analysis, I understand the core technical architecture. Now I need clarification on specific product requirements and business logic to ensure we build exactly what you need.

---

## ‚úÖ What I Understand So Far

### Technical Architecture

- **Smart Contract**: FEC-compliant campaign contributions ($3,300 limit)
- **Frontend**: React app with Web3 wallet integration
- **Backend**: Express API with Supabase database
- **Networks**: Multi-chain support (Ethereum, Base, testnets)
- **Testing**: Comprehensive test suite with Playwright + Hardhat

### Core Features Identified

- Campaign setup wizard (existing)
- Donation contribution flow (partially existing)
- KYC verification system (smart contract ready)
- Real-time transaction monitoring
- Compliance reporting and audit trails

## ‚ùì Questions for Product Requirements

### 1. **User Journey & Flow**

**Current State**: I see a campaign setup wizard but need clarity on the complete flow.

**Questions:**

- What's the complete user journey from landing page to successful donation?
- Are there different user types? (Campaign manager, donor, admin, compliance officer)
- Should donors register/create accounts, or is it wallet-only authentication?
- Do you want anonymous donations (wallet-only) or collected donor information?

**Impact**: Affects UI/UX design, database schema, and KYC integration approach.

---

### 2. **KYC Requirements & Process**

**Current State**: Smart contract has KYC verification built-in, but no UI implementation.

**Questions:**

- What's your KYC verification process? (Manual approval, third-party service, document upload?)
- Who performs KYC verification? (Campaign staff, automated service, third-party)
- What information needs to be collected for FEC compliance beyond wallet address?
- Should KYC be done before donation attempt or during the flow?
- Do you want to integrate with existing KYC providers (Jumio, Onfido, etc.)?

**Impact**: Determines KYC UI flow, data collection forms, verification workflow, and potential third-party integrations.

---

### 3. **Campaign Management**

**Current State**: Campaign setup wizard exists, but unclear on ongoing management.

**Questions:**

- Who manages campaigns? (Individual candidates, campaign staff, admins?)
- Can one organization run multiple campaigns simultaneously?
- Do campaigns have start/end dates or are they perpetual?
- What campaign customization is needed? (Colors, logos, messaging, donation amounts)
- Should campaign managers see real-time analytics/dashboards?

**Impact**: Affects admin interface design, multi-tenancy architecture, and analytics requirements.

---

### 4. **Donation Experience**

**Current State**: No donor interface exists yet - this is the critical missing piece.

**Questions:**

- What donation amounts do you want to suggest? (Preset buttons like $25, $50, $100, $500, custom amount)
- Should donors see campaign progress/goals/thermometer?
- Do you want recurring donations or one-time only?
- Should donors receive confirmation emails/receipts?
- What information should be displayed during the donation process?

**Impact**: Core to the donation UI design and user experience.

---

### 5. **Compliance & Reporting**

**Current State**: Smart contract handles basic FEC compliance, but reporting unclear.

**Questions:**

- What FEC reports need to be generated? (Automated export formats?)
- Do you need integration with existing campaign finance software?
- What audit trails beyond blockchain transactions are required?
- Should the system handle refunds for compliance violations?
- Do you need real-time compliance monitoring/alerts?

**Impact**: Determines reporting interface, export functionality, and monitoring systems.

---

### 6. **Payment & Treasury Management**

**Current State**: Smart contract sends funds to a treasury address.

**Questions:**

- How should campaign funds be managed? (Multi-sig wallet, single address, escrow?)
- Do you want automatic conversion to USD stablecoins, or keep as ETH/crypto?
- Should there be spending controls/approvals for fund usage?
- Do you need integration with traditional banking for cash-out?
- What happens to funds if a campaign is suspended/ended?

**Impact**: Treasury management interface, multi-sig integration, and fund conversion workflows.

---

### 7. **Notifications & Communications**

**Current State**: No notification system exists.

**Questions:**

- What notifications do you want? (Donation confirmations, KYC status, compliance alerts)
- Should notifications go to donors, campaign managers, or both?
- Preferred channels? (Email, SMS, in-app, push notifications)
- Do you want automated thank you messages for donors?
- Should there be campaign updates/newsletters to donors?

**Impact**: Notification infrastructure, email service integration, and communication workflows.

---

### 8. **Security & Privacy**

**Questions:**

- What PII (Personally Identifiable Information) needs to be stored vs. kept off-chain?
- Do you have specific security compliance requirements? (SOC2, GDPR, etc.)
- Should donor information be anonymous/pseudonymous or fully identified?
- What data retention policies are needed?
- Do you need data export capabilities for donors (GDPR "right to data")?

**Impact**: Database design, privacy controls, and compliance infrastructure.

---

### 9. **Integration Requirements**

**Questions:**

- Do you need integration with existing campaign tools? (CRM systems, email marketing, accounting software)
- Should this connect to traditional payment processors for fiat donations too?
- Do you want social sharing features for campaigns?
- Integration with campaign websites/landing pages?
- API access for third-party developers?

**Impact**: API design, webhook systems, and third-party integration architecture.

---

### 10. **Deployment & Operations**

**Questions:**

- What's your preferred deployment environment? (AWS, Vercel, self-hosted)
- Do you need staging/testing environments for campaigns to test before going live?
- What level of operational monitoring do you need?
- Who will manage system operations and user support?
- What's your budget for infrastructure and third-party services?

**Impact**: DevOps setup, monitoring infrastructure, and operational procedures.

---

## üéØ Priority Clarification

**To build the most valuable product quickly, which of these areas should I focus on first?**

### Suggested Priority Order:

1. **Donation Experience** - Core missing functionality
2. **KYC Process** - Required for compliance
3. **Campaign Management** - Needed for campaign operators
4. **Compliance Reporting** - Essential for legal operation
5. **Advanced Features** - Notifications, integrations, etc.

---

## üîÑ Next Steps

After you provide clarification on these requirements, I can:

1. **Update the technical architecture** based on your specific needs
2. **Create detailed user flows** for each identified persona
3. **Build the missing components** starting with highest priority
4. **Set up proper testing scenarios** that match real-world usage
5. **Create deployment plans** tailored to your operational needs

**Which areas would you like to discuss first, and are there any critical requirements I haven't identified?**
