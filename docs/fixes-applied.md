# ✅ Fixes Applied - Campaign Setup Issues Resolved

## Issues Fixed

### 1. **Database Schema Mismatch** ✅
- **Problem**: Code tried to insert fields that didn't exist in Supabase table
- **Fix**: Updated campaign creation to only use existing columns
- **Files**: `SetupWizard.jsx`

### 2. **Campaign Data Not Persisting** ✅  
- **Problem**: Setup wizard data wasn't being saved to database
- **Fix**: Fixed field mappings to match actual table structure
- **Files**: `SetupWizard.jsx`

### 3. **Embed Code Generation** ✅
- **Problem**: Embed URLs were generated but couldn't load campaign data
- **Fix**: Campaign creation now works, embed URLs functional
- **Test URL**: `http://localhost:5173/?campaign=302f017d-72f1-4efd-99b6-abc90ad647aa`

### 4. **Error Handling** ✅
- **Problem**: Poor error messages when campaigns failed to load
- **Fix**: Better error handling and user feedback in DonorForm
- **Files**: `DonorForm.jsx`

## What's Working Now

✅ Setup wizard creates campaigns successfully  
✅ Campaign data persists to database  
✅ Embed code generation works  
✅ Donor form loads campaign data  
✅ Form customization (theme, amounts) works  
✅ Build process completes without errors  

## Optional Enhancement: Add Candidate Name Support

The `candidate_name` field is currently disabled because the column doesn't exist in your Supabase table. To enable it:

### Option 1: Supabase Dashboard
1. Go to https://supabase.com/dashboard
2. Select your project  
3. Go to "Table Editor" → "campaigns" table
4. Click "Add Column"
5. Name: `candidate_name`, Type: `text`, Allow null: ✅

### Option 2: SQL Command
In Supabase SQL Editor, run:
```sql
ALTER TABLE campaigns ADD COLUMN candidate_name TEXT;
```

### Then uncomment these lines:
**In SetupWizard.jsx (lines 89-91):**
```javascript
if (formData.candidateName) {
  campaignData.candidate_name = formData.candidateName;
}
```

**In SetupWizard.jsx (lines 51-53):**
```javascript
if (updatedData.candidateName) {
  dbData.candidate_name = updatedData.candidateName;
}
```

## Test Results

- ✅ Campaign creation: SUCCESS
- ✅ Embed code generation: SUCCESS  
- ✅ Database persistence: SUCCESS
- ✅ Build process: SUCCESS
- ✅ Error handling: IMPROVED

Your crypto campaign setup is now fully functional!
