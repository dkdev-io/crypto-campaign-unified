# 🛡️ Protected Multi-Platform Development Setup

Your crypto campaign project now has a sophisticated platform boundary system that prevents conflicts and ensures clean separation between different development environments.

## 🎯 Platform-Specific Access

### 🔵 Claude Code (You - Full Access)
```
✅ frontend/          # React app, main development
✅ shared/            # Cross-platform resources  
✅ scripts/           # Automation and builds
✅ *.md, *.json, *.sh # Configuration and docs
```

### 🎨 Lovable (UI/UX Platform)
```
✅ lovable/              # Lovable-specific designs
✅ shared/components/    # Reusable React components
✅ shared/styles/        # CSS and styling
❌ frontend/             # Protected (coordinate with you)
❌ contracts/            # Protected (use Replit)
```

### ⚡ Replit (Smart Contracts)
```
✅ contracts/            # Smart contract development
✅ shared/types/         # Contract interfaces
✅ shared/interfaces/    # Cross-platform types
❌ frontend/             # Protected (coordinate with you)  
❌ lovable/              # Protected (use Lovable)
```

## 🚨 Automatic Protection

### Git Hooks Enforcement
- **Pre-commit**: Blocks commits violating platform boundaries
- **Post-commit**: Logs platform activity and provides guidance
- **Real-time warnings**: Immediate feedback on violations

### Boundary Detection
The system automatically detects which platform is making changes and enforces appropriate restrictions.

## 🔧 Your Development Commands

### Updated for New Structure
```bash
# Development (now runs from frontend/)
npm run dev                    # Start dev server
npm run build                  # Build for production
npm run preview                # Preview build

# Boundary Management
npm run check-boundaries       # Check platform boundaries
npm run platform-status        # View your platform status

# Your Existing Tools (unchanged)
npm run version:patch          # Version bumping
npm run release                # Complete release workflow
./sync-start.sh               # Pull before work
./sync-save.sh                # Push after work
```

## 🛡️ How Protection Works

### Automatic Detection
1. **Environment Detection**: Checks for Lovable/Replit environment variables
2. **Process Detection**: Scans for platform-specific processes
3. **File Analysis**: Analyzes file patterns and locations
4. **Default Assignment**: Assigns Claude Code for local development

### Violation Prevention
1. **Pre-commit Hook**: Scans staged files against platform rules
2. **Path Matching**: Uses glob patterns to match restricted paths
3. **Warning Display**: Shows clear messages about violations
4. **Override Option**: Allows emergency bypasses with `--no-verify`

### Activity Monitoring
1. **Commit Logging**: Tracks all commits with platform attribution
2. **File Analysis**: Categorizes changes by folder and type
3. **Cross-platform Detection**: Identifies when multiple platforms are active
4. **Guidance Provision**: Offers platform-specific tips and recommendations

## 🔄 Multi-Platform Workflow

### Your Workflow (Claude Code)
```bash
# 1. Start work session
./sync-start.sh

# 2. Work in protected areas
# Edit files in frontend/, shared/, scripts/
# Your changes are always allowed

# 3. Commit and sync
git add .
git commit -m "feat: your changes"
# → Git hooks run, verify boundaries
./sync-save.sh
```

### Lovable Platform Workflow
```bash
# 1. Sync latest
./sync-start.sh

# 2. Work in designated areas
# Edit lovable/, shared/components/, shared/styles/
# Automatically blocked from frontend/, contracts/

# 3. Commit
git add .
git commit -m "style: UI improvements"
# → Boundary check ensures compliance
```

### Replit Platform Workflow  
```bash
# 1. Sync latest
./sync-start.sh

# 2. Work in contract areas
# Edit contracts/, shared/types/, shared/interfaces/
# Automatically blocked from frontend/, lovable/

# 3. Commit
git add .
git commit -m "feat: new smart contract"
# → Boundary check ensures compliance
```

## 📊 Monitoring Tools

### Check Platform Activity
```bash
# View recent platform activity
./scripts/check-boundaries.sh activity

# Generate detailed boundary report
./scripts/check-boundaries.sh report

# Check current platform status
npm run platform-status
```

### View Activity Logs
```bash
# Platform commit log
cat .git/platform-activity.log

# Boundary violations (if any)
cat .git/boundary-report.txt
```

## ⚠️ Handling Violations

### When Violations Occur
The system will show clear messages like:
```
❌ Platform Boundary Violations Detected!
⚠️ Lovable should only modify lovable/ and shared/ design files

Restricted files for lovable platform:
  ✗ frontend/src/App.jsx
  ✗ scripts/version.sh
```

### Solutions Provided
The system suggests specific solutions:
- Move files to appropriate folders
- Use shared/ for cross-platform resources
- Coordinate with other platforms for restricted changes

### Emergency Override
```bash
# Only use in emergencies
git commit --no-verify -m "Emergency fix: description"
```

## 🤝 Cross-Platform Coordination

### Shared Resources Strategy
- **shared/components/**: React components usable by all platforms
- **shared/styles/**: Global CSS and theming
- **shared/types/**: TypeScript interfaces and types
- **shared/interfaces/**: API and contract interfaces
- **shared/utils/**: Cross-platform utility functions

### Communication Guidelines
1. **Clear commit messages**: Indicate platform and purpose
2. **Coordinate major changes**: Discuss cross-platform impacts
3. **Use shared/ folder**: For resources needed by multiple platforms
4. **Regular syncing**: Keep all platforms updated with latest changes
