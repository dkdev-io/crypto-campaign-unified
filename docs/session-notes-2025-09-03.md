# Session Notes - September 3, 2025

## Session Summary

**Focus**: Test Email Policy Implementation for Puppeteer Tests

## Changes Made

### 1. Updated Puppeteer Test Files

- **Files Modified**:
  - `/tests/puppeteer-auth-test.js` - Changed to use `test@dkdev.io` only
  - `/tests/puppeteer-form-submission-test.js` - Changed to use `test@dkdev.io` only

### 2. Created Test Email Policy

- **New File**: `/tests/TEST_EMAILS_POLICY.md`
- Documents that ONLY `test@dkdev.io` should be used for testing
- Explains why fake/random emails cause Supabase issues

### 3. Updated CLAUDE.md

- Added critical guardrail section: "TEST EMAIL POLICY"
- Made it mandatory for all agents to use only `test@dkdev.io`
- Violations result in immediate task failure

## Key Decision

**Rationale**: Using multiple fake emails was causing Supabase authentication failures and email verification issues. Standardizing on a single approved email address (`test@dkdev.io`) ensures consistent testing behavior.

## Files Requiring Future Updates

Found 13 scripts in `/scripts` folder still using dynamic email generation:

- test-auth-live.js
- test-campaign-auth.js
- test-donor-auth.js
- fix-supabase-auth.js
- configure-supabase-email.js
- And others...

These should be updated if actively used.

## Repository Status

- All changes committed and pushed
- Repository up to date with origin/main
- 2 untracked test files remain (not critical)

## Technical Notes

- Found 240 files with console.log statements (expected in development)
- App dashboard tools not available in current environment

## Next Steps

1. Update remaining scripts to use approved test email
2. Monitor Supabase authentication for improved stability
3. Ensure all future tests follow the email policy
