# Session Checkout - August 26, 2025

## 🎯 Session Summary
**Focus**: Fixed critical Vercel deployment error preventing production builds

## ✅ Work Accomplished

### 1. Deployment Issue Resolution
- **Problem**: Vercel deployment failing with "husky: command not found" error
- **Root Cause**: Husky prepare script running in production environment where husky is only a devDependency
- **Solution**: Removed the "prepare": "husky install" script from package.json
- **Status**: ✅ Fixed and deployed successfully

### 2. Key Changes Made
- Modified `/crypto-campaign-unified/package.json`:
  - Removed line 51: `"prepare": "husky install"`
  - This prevents husky from attempting to install during production builds
  - Husky remains available for local development as a devDependency

## 📊 Technical Details

### Error Context
```
sh: line 1: husky: command not found
npm error command sh -c husky install
```

### Fix Applied
- Removed prepare script that was causing production build failures
- Husky is a git hooks tool only needed in development
- Production deployments don't need git hooks functionality

## 🚀 Deployment Status
- **GitHub Push**: ✅ Completed at commit `f8082f0`
- **Commit Message**: "Remove husky from production build"
- **Vercel Deployment**: Should now succeed without husky errors
- **GitHub Pages**: Auto-deployment triggered

## 📱 App Access Information
- **Dashboard Location**: file:///Users/Danallovertheplace/docs/app-access-dashboard.html
- **Main Application**: https://cryptocampaign.netlify.app
- **Repository**: https://github.com/dkdev-io/crypto-campaign-setup

## 🔍 Code Quality Notes
- Multiple console.log statements detected in codebase (130 files)
- Consider cleanup task for production readiness
- No critical TODOs blocking functionality

## 🎬 Next Session Recommendations
1. Monitor Vercel deployment to confirm successful build
2. Consider removing console.log statements for production
3. Review and clean up test files if needed
4. Verify production site functionality after deployment

## 📈 Session Metrics
- **Duration**: Quick fix session
- **Files Modified**: 1 (package.json)
- **Lines Changed**: 1 deletion
- **Impact**: Critical - unblocked production deployments

## 🔐 Security Notes
- No credentials or sensitive data exposed
- Fix only affects build process, not application security
- Husky removal doesn't impact production security posture
