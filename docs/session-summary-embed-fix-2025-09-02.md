# Session Summary - Embed Form Fix
**Date**: September 2, 2025  
**Issue**: Embed form URLs returning 404 errors  
**Status**: ✅ **RESOLVED**

## 🎯 Problem Identified
The embed form at `https://dkdev-io.github.io/crypto-campaign-setup//embed-form.html?campaign=91323410-1081-40ff-a931-517785995ff8` was returning 404 errors.

**Root Cause**: Missing React routes for embed form URLs
- React Router had no route for `/embed-form.html` 
- Netlify redirects all requests to React app via `/* /index.html 200`
- Missing routes fell through to NotFound component

## ✅ Solution Implemented
Added missing routes to `frontend/src/App.jsx`:

```javascript
{/* Embed Form Route - for iframe embeds */}
<Route path="/embed-form.html" element={
  <div style={{ minHeight: '100vh', padding: '1rem' }}>
    <SimpleDonorForm campaignId={new URLSearchParams(window.location.search).get('campaign')} />
  </div>
} />
<Route path="/embed-form" element={
  <div style={{ minHeight: '100vh', padding: '1rem' }}>
    <SimpleDonorForm campaignId={new URLSearchParams(window.location.search).get('campaign')} />
  </div>
} />
```

## 📊 Results
- ✅ **Fixed**: `/embed-form.html` now returns 200 status
- ✅ **Deployed**: Auto-deployed to Netlify via GitHub integration
- ✅ **Tested**: Both localhost and production URLs working
- ✅ **Component**: SimpleDonorForm renders with campaign ID from query params
