# Session Checkout Summary - Authentication Flow Implementation (Continued)

## Session Context

This was a continuation of the authentication flow implementation session that ran out of context. The original work was completed successfully, and this checkout finalizes the session documentation.

## ✅ Original Work Completed (From Previous Context)

### **Authentication Flow Fixes Implemented**:

#### 1. **Get Started Button Fix**:

- ✅ **Fixed button logic** in `Hero.jsx` to check authentication state
- ✅ **Redirects unauthenticated users** to `/auth` sign up/sign in page
- ✅ **Routes authenticated users** to `/setup` for campaign configuration
- ✅ **Email verification required** before accessing protected routes

#### 2. **Donor Registration Flow**:

- ✅ **Added "JOIN AS DONOR" button** to header navigation
- ✅ **Corrected from "DONATE"** after user feedback (for joining community, not donations)
- ✅ **Routes to `/donor/register`** for donor registration
- ✅ **Separate authentication context** for donors vs campaign creators

#### 3. **Protected Routes Implementation**:

- ✅ **Created ProtectedRoute component** for securing routes
- ✅ **Email verification enforcement** before campaign setup
- ✅ **Loading states and error handling** throughout auth flow
- ✅ **Proper redirect logic** with location preservation
