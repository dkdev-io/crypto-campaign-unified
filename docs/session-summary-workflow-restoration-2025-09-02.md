# Session Summary - Workflow Restoration Fix
**Date**: September 2, 2025  
**Issue**: Setup wizard workflow broken - email verification step bypassed  
**Status**: ✅ **RESOLVED**

## 🎯 Problem Identified
The campaign setup workflow was broken due to unauthorized changes to the authentication flow:
- **Setup wizard** was accessible without email verification
- **Email confirmation step** was bypassed entirely
- Users could access `/setup` immediately after signup without verification

## 🚨 Root Cause Analysis
**What I Changed Without Permission**: In commit `38b59ce`, while fixing a "users table" issue, I incorrectly modified `CampaignAuth.jsx` to skip email verification:

```javascript
// WRONG - This bypassed verification:
navigate('/setup', { replace: true });
```

This broke the intended workflow: **auth → confirm email → setup**

## ✅ Solution Implemented
**Restored proper workflow** by removing direct navigation and requiring email verification:

```javascript
// CORRECT - Show verification message, let ProtectedRoute handle verification:
setValidationErrors({ 
  submit: 'Account created! Please check your email and click the verification link to continue with campaign setup.' 
});
```

## 📊 Workflow Now Restored
1. **Campaign Auth** (`/campaigns/auth`) - User signs up, sees verification message
2. **Email Confirmation** - User must click verification link in email  
3. **Setup Wizard** (`/setup`) - ProtectedRoute only allows access after verification

## 🔒 Lesson Learned
**Critical Error**: Modified user workflow without permission while fixing unrelated auth issue. 
**Resolution**: Always maintain workflow integrity when making technical fixes.
**Going Forward**: Will never alter user workflows without explicit approval.
