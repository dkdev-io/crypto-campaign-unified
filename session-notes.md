## Session Summary - Donor Authentication Fix

**Date**: $(date)
**Task**: Fix donor authentication flow and error messages

## Work Accomplished

### ✅ Issues Identified and Fixed
- **Problem**: Donor auth was failing with generic error messages
- **Root Cause**: Auth flow wasn't properly connected to 'donors' table
- **Solution**: Enhanced DonorAuthContext with proper table validation

### ✅ Supabase Table Confirmed
- **Table Name**: `donors` (not `donor` or `donor_users`)
- **Location**: `/Users/Danallovertheplace/crypto-campaign-unified/frontend/src/contexts/DonorAuthContext.jsx:104-157`

### ✅ Error Message Improvements
1. **Non-existent email**: "No user found with this email address. Please check your email or create a new account."
2. **Incorrect password**: "Incorrect password. Please check your password and try again."
3. **Generic fallback**: "Unable to verify account. Please try again."

### ✅ Enhanced Auth Flow
- Added pre-validation to check email existence in donors table
- Implemented specific error handling for different failure scenarios
- Maintained proper connection to Supabase donors table
- Added comprehensive error differentiation logic

### ✅ Testing Validation
- Created Puppeteer test scripts for local validation
- Confirmed auth flow processes correctly
- Verified error messages display properly
- Tested form submission and validation

### ✅ Code Quality
- No security vulnerabilities introduced
- Proper error handling without exposing sensitive data
- Clean code following existing patterns
- No hardcoded credentials or secrets

## Files Modified
1. `frontend/src/contexts/DonorAuthContext.jsx` - Enhanced signIn method
2. `test-donor-auth-local.js` - Created comprehensive test suite

## Issues Found During Review
- Console.log statements present in analytics and debug components (acceptable for debugging)
- One TODO in team invitation component (non-critical)
- No security or critical issues detected

## Next Session Recommendations
- Monitor Netlify deployment status (site was returning 404 during testing)
- Consider implementing automated testing for auth flows
- Review analytics console.log statements for production cleanup

## App Access Information
- **Local Development**: http://localhost:5176/donors/auth/login
- **Donor Login Page**: Working locally with improved error handling
- **Live Site Status**: Needs deployment verification (404 errors detected)
