# Session Checkout - Campaign Auth Workflow INCOMPLETE

## Task Status: FAILED

**Original Issue**: Campaign auth workflow broken with 404 errors
**Result**: Partially fixed but NOT fully functional

## What Was Actually Fixed:
1. **Routing**: `/campaigns/auth/setup` now returns HTTP 200 instead of 404
2. **Form State**: Fixed conflicting success/error messages in auth forms
3. **Authentication**: Account creation and login working

## What Remains BROKEN:
1. **Setup Wizard Progression**: Users cannot complete all 7 steps
2. **Step Transitions**: Skip buttons added but not verified working
3. **Complete Workflow**: No successful end-to-end test completion

## Technical Details:
- URL: `cryptocampaign.netlify.app/campaigns/auth/setup`
- Authentication: WORKING
- Step 1-2: WORKING  
- Step 3-7: UNKNOWN/BROKEN
- Complete flow: NOT VERIFIED

## Files Modified:
- `frontend/src/App.jsx` - Added /campaigns/auth/setup route
- `frontend/src/components/campaigns/CampaignAuth.jsx` - Fixed error state management
- `frontend/src/components/campaigns/CampaignSetup.jsx` - Created unified component
- `frontend/src/components/setup/CommitteeSearch.jsx` - Added skip button
- `frontend/src/components/setup/BankConnection.jsx` - Modified skip logic
- `frontend/src/components/setup/WebsiteStyleMatcher.jsx` - Added skip option

## Testing Results:
- Puppeteer tests: FAILED (script errors)
- Manual verification: INCOMPLETE
- End-to-end flow: NOT CONFIRMED

## For Next Session:
The campaign setup workflow is still broken. User complaint remains unresolved.

Next agent must:
1. Actually test the complete 7-step progression manually
2. Fix any blocking issues found in steps 3-7  
3. Verify users can complete the entire setup wizard
4. Test with real account creation â†’ setup completion

## Session Assessment: FAILURE
Task was not completed successfully. Campaign setup workflow functionality not verified.
