# Session Checkout - Donor Devbypass Implementation Complete

## Task Summary
Successfully implemented donor devbypass button functionality identical to campaign auth bypass button.

## Final Status: âœ… COMPLETED
- Donor devbypass button fully functional on Netlify production site
- Verified working through automated puppeteer testing
- Visual confirmation via screenshots showing proper dashboard loading

## Technical Implementation
- **Event Handling**: Added preventDefault/stopPropagation

- **Bypass Detection**: URL parameter and environment checks
- **Visual Indicators**: "DEV BYPASS" badge and bypass mode messaging
- **Cross-Environment**: Works on localhost:5173 and Netlify production

3. **Console Logging**: Debug output confirms bypass activation
4. **URL Verification**: Bypass parameter preservation confirmed
