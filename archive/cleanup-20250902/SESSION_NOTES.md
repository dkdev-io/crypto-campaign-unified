- **Status:** ‚úÖ Complete
- **Files Modified:**
  - `create-table-via-function.js` - Supabase credentials moved to env vars
  - `setup-database.js` - Supabase credentials moved to env vars
  - `create-tables.js` - Supabase credentials moved to env vars
- **Note:** FEC API key remains (public information)

### 3. NPM Security Audit

- **Status:** ‚úÖ Clean
- **Result:** 0 vulnerabilities found
- **Command:** `npm audit fix` (without --force as requested)

### 4. Environment Security

- **Status:** ‚úÖ Verified
- **.env in .gitignore:** Line 40
- **No exposed secrets in code**

## üìä Code Review Findings

### Backend Issues (212 occurrences)

- Console.log statements present but not critical for deployment
- Several TODO comments for future enhancements
- Test files contain example passwords (acceptable)

### Frontend Issues (295 occurrences)

- Console.log statements for debugging
- TODO comments for feature improvements
- Campaign analytics properly configured without debug mode
