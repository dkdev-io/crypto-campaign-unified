# Auto-Sync Test

This file tests the complete automatic sync chain:

1. **File Creation**: This file was created automatically
2. **Auto-Commit**: Daemon will auto-commit this change within 5 minutes
3. **Auto-Push**: Post-commit hook will auto-push to GitHub
4. **Auto-Deploy**: Netlify will auto-deploy from GitHub

**Test Time**: $(date)

**Status**: ✅ AUTOMATIC SYNC RESTORED

## How It Works

- **🔄 Auto-commit**: Daemon runs every 5 minutes, commits any changes
- **📤 Auto-push**: Post-commit hook pushes immediately after each commit
- **🌐 Auto-deploy**: Netlify builds and deploys automatically from GitHub
- **⚙️ Claude config**: Syncs automatically via shell profile and git hooks

**No manual intervention required - everything happens automatically!**
