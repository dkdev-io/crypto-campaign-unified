## Session Summary - Navy Blue Theme Implementation

### Work Accomplished:

2. **Complete Color Scheme Update**: Applied consistent navy blue background across all pages
3. **Navigation Enhancement**: Added black corner brackets to all navigation bars
4. **Component Updates**: Modified 8+ key components with correct navy theme
5. **CSS Corrections**: Updated index.css, setup.css, auth.css with proper colors
6. **Verification System**: Created Puppeteer analysis script for live site validation
7. **Deployment Pipeline**: Ensured changes pushed to GitHub → Netlify deployment
